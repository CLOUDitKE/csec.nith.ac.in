						A haunted place is a place or a building often perceived as being inhabited by disembodied spirits of the deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Parapsychologists attribute haunting to the spirits of the dead and the effect of violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide. More scientific explanations for the perception that a house is haunted include misinterpreting noises naturally present in structures, waking dreams, suggestibility, and the effect of toxic substances in environments that can cause hallucination.
That's all scientific stuff besides there is no deniability to the fact that talking about "Haunted Places"
is sure intriguing and at the same time sends down a chill to the spine and visiting one is altogether a different experience.<br><br>
Create web pages depicting haunted places around the place and make sure to make them the way that would really shit the crap out cos that's gonna put you top a notch in the contest.<br><br>
Well just saying there is a rumour around our college "NIT HAMIRPUR" that a guy named Ravi commited suicide in the first year Boy"s Hostel 'KBH' and his soul still haunts the C-block of the hostel and late at night you get a Bluetooth connection out of nowhere.<br><br>
You should visit it sometimes, you may get an incoming file request from the much quoted Bluetooth device of the deceased.
